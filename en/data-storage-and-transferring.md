# Data storage and transferring

## [SQL](sql)

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)

## [NoSQL](nosql)

NoSQL (originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational") is an approach to database design that focuses on providing a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Instead of the typical tabular structure of a relational database, NoSQL databases house data within one data structure. Since this non-relational database design does not require a schema, it offers rapid scalability to manage large and typically unstructured data sets. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called "Not only SQL" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages or sit alongside SQL databases in polyglot-persistent architectures [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)
