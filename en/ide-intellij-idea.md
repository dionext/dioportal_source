## Using Lombok

[https://www.baeldung.com/lombok-ide#intellij-apt](https://www.baeldung.com/lombok-ide#intellij-apt) Setting up Lombok with Eclipse and Intellij

Our experience:

you may get problem with ...m2\\repository\\org\\projectlombok\\lombok\\unknown\\lombok-unknown.jar

To avoid that - use exact version of Lombok or do not use annotationProcessorPaths in maven-compiler-plugin

[https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-332869/Incompatible-Lombok-version-leads-to-error-NoSuchFieldError-com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree-qualid-during-project-compilation](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-332869/Incompatible-Lombok-version-leads-to-error-NoSuchFieldError-com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree-qualid-during-project-compilation)

Upgrade Lombok to the compatible version. JDK21 - Lombok 1.18.30 JDK22 - Lombok 1.18.32
