# Using for Media (Arts, Images, Video, Design, etc.)

## Images

### Dall-E (OpenAI)

[https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/) DALL-E, DALL-E 2, and DALL-E 3 (stylised DALLÂ·E, and pronounced DOLL-E) are text-to-image models developed by OpenAI using deep learning methodologies to generate digital images from natural language descriptions known as prompts.

### Stable Diffusion (Stability AI)

[https://stability.ai/stable-image](https://stability.ai/stable-image) **[https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models](https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models)**

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022 based on diffusion techniques. The generative artificial intelligence technology is the premier product of Stability AI and is considered to be a part of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt. Its development involved researchers from the CompVis Group at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Runway with a computational donation from Stability and training data from non-profit organizations.

### MidJourney

[https://www.midjourney.com/](https://www.midjourney.com/) Midjourney is a generative artificial intelligence program and service created and hosted by the San Francisco-based independent research lab Midjourney, Inc. Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions, called prompts, similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion. It is one of the technologies of the AI boom.
