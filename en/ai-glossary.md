# AI. Glossary

**Artificial intelligence (AI)**, in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.

**Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT)** are a type of large language model (LLM) and a prominent framework for generative artificial intelligence. They are artificial neural networks that are used in natural language processing tasks. GPTs are based on the transformer architecture, pre-trained on large data sets of unlabelled text, and able to generate novel human-like content. As of 2023, most LLMs have these characteristics and are sometimes referred to broadly as GPTs.

**Generative AI (GenAI)** is currently a hot topic in the tech world. It's a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, such as text, images, or music. One popular type of GenAI component is the Large Language Model (LLM), which can generate human-like text based on a prompt.

**Artificial general intelligence (AGI)** is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that matches or surpasses human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. This contrasts with narrow AI, which is limited to specific tasks. Artificial superintelligence (ASI), on the other hand, refers to AGI that greatly exceeds human cognitive capabilities. AGI is considered one of the definitions of strong AI. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_general\_intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) {#id1}

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models by grounding them in external knowledge sources. While most GenAI applications and related content are centered around Python and its ecosystem, what if you want to write a GenAI application in Java?

**Low-rank adaptation (LoRA)** is a technique for quickly adapting machine learning models to new contexts. LoRA helps make huge and complicated machine learning models much more suited for specific uses. It works by adding lightweight pieces to the original model, as opposed to changing the entire model. LoRA helps developers quickly expand the use cases for the machine learning models they build.

**Tokens** are words or parts of words. Roughly, 100 tokens equal about 75 words of Latin text. OpenAI model requests are priced based on the number of tokens used: that is, the "cost" of calling the API depends on the length of both the input and output text.

**"vibe coding"** represents a shift where anyone can build software by describing what they want in plain English to AI tools. [https://bensbites.com/blog/what-is-vibe-coding](https://bensbites.com/blog/what-is-vibe-coding)
**Model Context Protocol** The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.
